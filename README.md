# Computer Vision - NTUA (2020-2021)

This repository hosts the **lab projects** and **theoretical problem sets** of the Computer Vision course held by ECE NTUA during the Spring 2021.

# Lab Projects

## Lab 1: Interest Point Detection and Feature Extraction in Images

For the code to be small enough, we had to remove the image outputs within the notebooks. The code is structured to simply run it and produce the images (after arranging the directories with the input images a little bit).
